Since then, he has accumulated over 1200 kitties and is questioning life in general as a result. He spent the previous 10 years bringing cloud computing to the mainstream and is ready to do the same thing for the next 10 years with blockchain technology.</p>

           <p class="column is-12 100bio"> I am 25 years of age, full Japanese and fourth generation in America.  I attended the University of Hawaii for two years only to move back from my original home of Seattle to attend the University of Washington.  I dropped College to pursue my career in the tech/gaming industry and am here now.  I am really excited about this opportunity to add more usability to  our precious CryptoKitties for this amazing community!</p>
           
           <p class="column is-12">What's your favorite CryptoKitten? My favorite CK is the <a href="https://www.cryptokitties.co/kitty/690404">beautiful angel cat</a>.  As angelic as the appearance, the wasntme face adds a mysterious and up to no good factor to the mix.</p>
           
           <p class="column is-12">What's your favorite CryptoKitties trait? My favorite CK trait has to be Daemonwings because aside from looking amazing, it opens up the possibility to CK evolving into a game with flying creatures which is amazing in my eyes.</p>
           
           <p class="column is-12">What's your favorite KittyBattles origin? My favorite origin has to be seaside because it reminds me of a water type creature which have always been my favorite because they usually seem to be the most versatile from my experience in battle games. </p>

She’s made stickers for the Valentine’s and Meme releases for KittyHats and is now flexing her UX/UI skills to help get KittyBattles off and running.  If she’s not heads down on her computer you’ll find her playing with yarn (spinning, knitting, crochet), with her hubby and two sweetest kitties, or her mandolin.</p>
