        v1.1 -   Initial Alpha Testing

        A limited number of pawesome player will be invited to take place in the Alpha test. With their help, we will smooth over the rough edges so we can open the game up to a wider audience. This phase will focus primarily on the battles themselves.  Other parts of the game may not be functional at this time.  Player progress will be reset for the Beta.

        v1.2  -   Initial Beta Testing

        A larger group of players will be invited to take place in the Beta test.  During this phase, more sections of the website will become functional so they can be debugged and improved according to feedback from the users.  The battle system will be improved as well, based on additional feedback from this phase. Player progress will be reset for the Final Beta


        v1.3 -   Final Beta Testing

        Alpha and Beta testers will have the opportunity to invite a few friends to try the game, along with any players who have expressed interest but have not been invited to a previous release.  During this phase, we will iron out all the little details that still have some wrinkles and look for final feedback on improvements before our public launch.  Player progress will be reset for the Public Launch.
