                        A limited number of pawesome players will be invited to take place in the Alpha test. With their help, we will smooth over
                        the rough edges so we can open the game up to a wider audience. This phase will focus primarily on
                        the battles themselves. Other parts of the game may not be functional at this time. Player progress
                        will be reset for the Beta.</p>

                        A larger group of players will be invited to take place in the Beta test. During this phase, more sections of the website
                        will become functional so they can be debugged and improved according to feedback from the users.
                        The battle system will be improved as well, based on additional feedback from this phase. Player
                        progress will be reset for the Final Beta</p>

                        Alpha and Beta testers will have the opportunity to invite a few friends to try the game, along with any players who have
                        expressed interest but have not been invited to a previous release. During this phase, we will iron
                        out all the little details that still have some wrinkles and look for final feedback on improvements
                        before our public launch. Player progress will be reset for the Public Launch.</p>
